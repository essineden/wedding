                                Michael/ Majo/ My elder bro/ My best friend is a person to keep. We may be miles apart now but I know we always and forever have each other's back. He's that person who will give you options and light in your decision making, someone reliable and won't leave you in bad times. He has always been and forever will be one of the few people I completely trust, my confidante. He's there to build your confidence when you start doubting yourself, support you in aidless times - the eldest brother that I never had. And right now, we may not talk that much because of different and busy schedules but it's undoubtedly that I'm one of the happiest to finally see him happy and in love with the one he truly deserves. From that childish, gamer, computer geek Majo to a mature, well rounded and loving husband. I couldn't be any prouder. Here's to a brighter future with your lovely wife, Cai. Cheers!!! </p>

                            And then it was our 2014 Christmas Party, She was stunningly beautiful with her "labas pusod" red dress. I attempted to request for a photo with her but someone got ahead of me <i>(whoever you are, I can't recall you but I forgive you)</i>. Going back, I was watching her from a distance - like a stalker, waiting for the right time to attack. A few moments later, I launched the attack and ask to have a photo with her. <strikethrough>So stalker moves</strikethrough> I mean, Patience is a virtue indeed. :)</p>

                        <p class="story-details">In a small garden at our favorite restaurant in Tagaytay.
                            I was supposed to bring her to Fortune Island but there was a storm back then. The waves looks dangerous so I didn't take the risk. <i>Papakasalan ko pa 'to no!</i>
                            My accomplice (her Maid of Honor) and I decided to take Plan B - Tagaytay.
                            We went to (3) different scenic places in Tagaytay but the great view was ruined by the clouds and the rain.
                            I feel so stressed and depressed that time but my heart tells me... "I can still do it, I can still pull this off". So I said to my accomplice, let's go to our favorite restaurant and we'll do it there. <i>PS: We ate first. we're so hungry!"</i>
                            I walked her to the small garden, held her hand and then I started crying <i>Yep! I was crying. I don't know I just know I love her so much</i>. I was not able to deliver my proposal message well because her face reaction is like... "Ano sinasabi nito?" so I just pulled out the ring and ask - "Will you marry me?". Obviously she said YES! <i> 'coz this website won't be here if she didn't!</i>
